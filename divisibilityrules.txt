Divisibility Rules
Divisibility rule of 2	Any number whose last digit is an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) is divisible by 2
Divisibility rule of 3	A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
Divisibility rule of 4	A number is divisible by 4, if the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4.
Divisibility rule of 5	A number is exactly divisible by 5 if it has the digits 0 or 5 at oneâ€™s place.
Divisibility rule of 6	A number is exactly divisible by 6 if that number is divisible by 2 and 3 both. It is because 2 and 3 are prime factors of 6.
Divisibility rule of 7	Double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining leading truncated number to check if the result is divisible by 7 until no further division is possible
Divisibility rule of 8	If the last three digits of a number are divisible by 8, then the number is completely divisible by 8.
Divisibility rule of 9	It is the same as of divisibility of 3. Sum of digits in the given number must be divisible by 9.
Divisibility rule of 11	If the difference of the sum of alternative digits of a number is divisible by 11, then that number is divisible by 11.
