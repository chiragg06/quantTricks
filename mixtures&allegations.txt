Mixture: It is the process of mixing two or more elements/ingredients together.

Allegation: It is a process or a rule that tells us how to mix two or more ingredients/mixtures to get the desired mixture of a certain price & concentration.

Formula Method:
Quantity of cheaper/ Quantity of dearer = (Price of dearer – Mean price)/ (Mean Price- Price of cheaper)

Illustration 1. If 20 kgs of rice which cost 45 Rs/Kg is mixed with 25 kgs of rice which costs 30 Rs/Kg. What will be the price of the final mixture?

Now as we know, (45-M)/(M-30)=25/20

⇒ (45-M)/(M-30)= 5/4

⇒180-4M = 5M- 150

⇒ 330= 9M

⇒ M= 330/9= 36.6 Rs/Kg
