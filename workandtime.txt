Basic Rules Related to Work and Time

Rule - 1: Work from Days:

If a person can do a piece of work in n days (hours), then that person's 1 day's (hour's), work = 1/n

Rule- 2 : Days from Work:

If a person's 1 day's (hour's) work = 1/n, then the person will complete the work in n days (hours).

Rule - 3

If a person is n times efficient than second person, then work done by :

Ratio of work done by First person and Second person = n : 1.

Ratio of times taken by First person and second person to finish a work = 1 : n.

Rule - 4

If ratio of numbers of men required to complete a work is m : n, then the ratio of time taken by them will be n : m.

2. Man - Work - Hour Formula:

More men can do more work.
More work means more time required to do work.
More men can do more work in less time.
M men can do a piece of work in T hours, then
Total effort or work = MT man hours.

Rate of work * Time = Work Done
If A can do a piece of work in D days, then A's 1 day's work = 1/D.
Part of work done by A for t days = t/D.

If A's 1 day's work = 1/D, then A can finish the work in D days.

Techniques - 1

M D H / W = Constant

Where,

   M = Number of men

   D = Number of days

   H = Number of hours per day

   W = Amount of work



Techniques - 2

If M1 men can do W1 work in D1 days working H1 hours per day and M2 men can do W2 work in D2 days working H2 hours per day, then

   
M1 D1 H1 / W1 = M2 D2 H2 / W2



Techniques - 3

If A is x times as good a workman as B, then:

Ratio of work done by A and B = x : 1

Ratio of times taken by A and B to finish a work = 1 : x ie; A will take (1/x)th of the time taken by B to do the same work.



Techniques - 4

A and B can do a piece of work in 'x' days and 'y' days respectively, then working together:

They will complete the work in (xy/x+y) days
In one day, they will finish (x+y/xy)th part of work.


Techniques - 5

If A can do a piece of work in 'x' days, B can do in 'y' days and C can do in 'z' days then,

A, B and C together can finish the same work in (xyz/xy+yz+zx) days



Techniques - 6

If A can do a work in 'x' days and A and B together can do the same work in 'y' days then,

Number of days required to complete the work if B works alone = (xy/x-y)days

TIPS on cracking Aptitude Questions on Work and Time

Tip #1: Assume that the productivity of each worker is constant

1.    Question: A alone can do a piece of work in 6 days and B alone in 8 days. A and B undertook to do it for Rs.3200. With the help of C, they completed the work in 3 days. How much is to be paid to C?

Solution:

Let the total amount of work to be done be W units.

Productivity of A, Pa = W/6 units per day.

Productivity of B, Pb = W/8 units per day.

3 days x [Pa + Pb + Pc] = W => Pc = W/24 units per day

Ratio of wages of A: B: C = Ratios of their productivities = (W/6): (W/8): (W/24) = 4: 3: 1.

Amount to be paid to C = Rs.3200 x (1/8) = Rs.400

2.    Question: It takes 6 hours for pump A, used alone, to fill a tank of water. Pump B used alone takes 8 hours to fill the same tank. We want to use three pumps: A, B and another pump C to fill the tank in 2 hours. What should be the rate of pump C? How long would it take pump C, used alone, to fill the tank?

Solution:

Let the total capacity of the tank be C liters.

Fill rate of pump A, Fa = C/6 liters per hr

Fill rate of pump B, Fb = C/8 liters per hr

2 hrs x [Fa + Fb + Fc] = C => Fc = 5C/24 liters per hr

Letâ€˜tâ€™ be the time taken by only pump C to fill the tank.

â€˜tâ€™ hrs x 5C/24 = C => t = 24/5 = 4.8 hrs
