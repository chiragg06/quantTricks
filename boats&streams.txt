How to solve Boats and Streams Problem Quickly In Aptitude
In water, the direction along the stream is called Downstream

The direction against the stream is called Upstream.
Boat Speed: The speed of a boat in still water (in km/h or m/s).
Stream Speed: The speed of the water current (in km/h or m/s).
 
The boats and streams problems are based on the concepts of time, speed, and distance. However, a few adjustments need to be made in case of such problems. There are some variations of these problems .
 

Use the formula:

Downstream Speed = Boat Speed + Stream Speed
Upstream Speed = Boat Speed – Stream Speed

Basic Formulas for Upstream and Downstream
1) If the speed of a boat in still water is u km/hr and the speed of the stream is v km/hr, then

Speed downstream = (u + v) km/hr
Speed upstream = (u – v) km/hr.

2)If the speed downstream is a km/hr and the speed upstream is b km/hr, then 

Speed in still water  1/2(a+b) km/hr
rate of stream 1/2(a-b) km/hr

3) Lets Assume that a man can row at the speed of x km/hr in still water and he rows the same distance up and down in a stream which flows at a rate of y km/hr. Then his average speed throughout the journey is :

    =	 	((Speed Downstream)*(Speed Upstream) )/	 	 	 
Speed in Still Water
    =	 	((x + y)*(x – y))/x	 	 	 

4)Let the speed of a man in still water be x km/hr and the speed of a stream be y km/hr. If he takes t hours more in upstream than to go downstream for the same distance, the distance travelled is

    =	 	((x^2 – y^2)*t )/2y
